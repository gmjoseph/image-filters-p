lots of boilerplate + utilities was grabbed from:
https://github.com/WebGLSamples/WebGL2Samples/blob/master/samples/utility.js
https://github.com/WebGLSamples/WebGL2Samples/blob/master/samples/sampler_wrap.html

to avoid having to reimplement matrices, image loading, shader program
compilation, etc. and get right down to the shaders to do the image
filtering.
